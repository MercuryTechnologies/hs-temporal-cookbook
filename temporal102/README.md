# Temporal 102 exercises, in Haskell

(Once we've finished the exercises, this needs an introduction.)

## Running the exercises

As with other Temporal cookbook environments, you'll start a nix shell
with `nix develop --accept-flake-config` in two terminals, one where you
plan to run code and one where you'll run the Temporal server. In the
latter, run:

```bash
$ temporal server start-dev
```

This will start a long-running control plane server that will execute
workflows against workers you write.
